The baby got a name that was used -- when the baby was not even in the scene. Fascinating: I had to add a few columns based on that test episode! </p><p>The spreadsheet has 20 columns. I&#39;ll refine and share the format once I&#39;ve finalized it. </p><p>😅 If I do keep this idea going, I&#39;ll probably just track episodes as they air to start.</p>   90
